# nn-SelfDrivingCar
This project showcases the development of a neural network model designed to simulate the learning process involved in steering a self-driving car. By observing this model, viewers can gain insights into how neural networks evolve and adapt over time, enhancing their understanding of artificial intelligence in the context of autonomous driving.

NOTE: this code was based from Dr.Radu Mariescu-Istodor's self-driving car https://github.com/gniziemazity/self-driving-car.git

I invite you to explore the diverse and interdisciplinary components that contribute to the creation of a self-driving car. Each area offers a unique perspective and is critical to the development and ethical deployment of these advanced systems:

### Computer Science (programming)

### Machine Learning - Neural Network

### Math/Physics

### Data Processing

### Ethics

### Philosophy
